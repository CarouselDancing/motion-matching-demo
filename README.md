# Motion Matching preprocessing and Unity demo 

The C# code is a port of the runtime implementation by Daniel Holden:  https://github.com/orangeduck/Motion-Matching

The Python preprocessing code is a copy with small modifications.

The scene Assets/MotionMatching/Demo/Scenes/main.unity contains a test of a locomotion controller.

Before running the code you need to download the data using the powershell script /mm_demo/Assets/Resources/download_data.ps1
